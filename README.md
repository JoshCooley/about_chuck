# Four things that I appreciate about Chuck

This document exists as a show of appreciation to Chuck, and to help them complete an assignment.
I've received no compensation beyond the benefit of their enduring friendship, of which I've surely taken advantage, with never quite the time or courage or words to express what it means to me.

But it is my task to share some words, so I soldier on.
Here are 4 of Chuck's traits that I appreciate.

* Honesty
* Willingness to leave parties
* Can make good food with whatever is left in kitchen
* Will just be doing art all the time


## Honesty

This mostly comes out in grocery stores. Chuck likes to talk about all the people we pass in the aisles. About how they have pretty hair, or they're bad at moving through the aisles, or they smell "...real nice", which means "like weed". Sometimes I think people hear Chuck and pretend they didn't.


## Willingness to leave parties

...and concerts, and workshops, and restaurants before we've ordered. Sometimes experiences get old before they're "done". Chuck's always cool to bail, and sometimes even recommends it. We've even been nearly to a place and just had a "bad vibe"; no big deal. We do something else.


## Can make good food with whatever is left in kitchen

Chuck has good sense for what kind of flavors an ingredient has, how heat will affect it, and if it would be good with beans. This is important, as there are usually beans when little else remains. But Chuck improvises, and these improvised recipes have been some of my favorite. An added bonus is that whatever is leftover is not usually meat, and experimenting with vegetarian cooking has made me feel like maybe I don't need meat anyway.


## Will just be doing art all the time

There's a whole category of noises that occurs in our house that I call "art noises". These are bangs and boxes moving and closets opening and closing and a lot of shuffling. They signify a new stage of an art project. Sometimes there are smells too. Or Chuck will be singing some weird song, and then I'll realize the lyrics are all like "WHY DOESN'T THAT ANGLE LOOOK RIIIGHT?" but like opera-y. And then I'll hear different noises in a different room and they've gone from drawing to sewing, making t-shirts shorter or putting the middle of a t-shirt on a sweat-shirt, or sewing a moon into a couch cushion. Then new art shows up on the walls and I say "Whoa! When did you do that?" and you're like "that's been there a month". But even if I don't notice it on the walls, I still appreciate the comforting noises when it's getting made.


Thanks Chuck. I hope this is sufficient because my wrist hurts and I need to get dressed.
